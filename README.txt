------------------------- Information -----------------------

This site is the website of Brothers Tourism Taxi, which is a taxi service 
in Brothers Tourism. The frontend part of the site does not belong to me. 
I developed this project by working on the template I chose at the request 
of the customer. After editing the template according to the content that 
the customer needs, I made changes on the template to make it more original 
and then I worked on the backend. After I finished the site, I uploaded it 
to the host. You can go to this link to review the Brother Tourism Taxi site, 
which is currently in active use;

Note: Since I made this site on my localhost and uploaded it to the host 
later, the smtp and db content in these files are different from the real 
site currently used.


-------------------------- How to Use -----------------------

db_host = localhost
db_user = root
db_pass = ""
db_name = brothers_tourism

Note: The name of the project folder can be run on localhost as brothers_tourism.
